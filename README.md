CONFIG
---

Edit `.env` file to setup the backend endpoint (optional - if you want to point it to localhost or elsewhere). Note that `.env` is in `.gitignore` so your local changes won't be added to git repository unless you explicitly add them.

RUN
---

As usual, `yarn install` will install all packages needed to `node_modules/` directory.

`yarn start` will run the app locally and start a browser.
